# Homework-1
For this assignment, I looked at the CSS and HTML and realized there was a lot of duplicate codes under different classes and ID's. To start off, usually the duplicate codes were in sets of 3. So I deleted two of them and just kept one class. I then replaced the now deleted classes, with the one remaining class in the HTML file. I also noticed, that all the text color, besides the footer, was the same. Insterad of having to list the same color in every class and tag, I just deleted them, and added color under the Universal tag. To make sure the footer was still black and not white, I added color to both the footer h2, and the footer h3. Within the HTml document, I replaced every div tag with different tags. I added the header tag to make it easier to identify what was what. I also had to refelct this change in the CSS. I added sections within the header, main, and aside. I added an aside tag to the elements that were being displayed on the right side of the website as well. This project was about cleaning up the document, and I fdeel as if I simplified it quite a bit, and made it easier to read.
